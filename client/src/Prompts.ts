    Could you generate a website with just a fully functioning Snake game using JavaScript? 
    - With a snake game, you have randomly spawning apples and a snake that you must move around with the arrow keys.  
    - Each apple eaten makes the snake longer.
    - If the snake runs into itself or a wall, you lose the game. We should show a 'You Lose' message if that happens.
    - If the snake manages to fill the screen, the player wins. We should display a 'You Win' message if that happens.
    - It should have a restart game button.
    - Make the snake game about 800px by 800px.
    - Have a header at the top of the page that says 'Mike's Awesome Snake Game!'
  
    The site should have a futuristic TRON style vibe with dark colors and bright neon text. I'd also like a background image behind the game of a TRON-like landscape.

    or live demos if applicable. The projects should be highlighted with unique, dynamic visuals, such as hover effects or animations that match the style of the project. Choose a modern, minimalist design style 
    with a muted color palette, but feel free to add subtle pops of color for emphasis. Use elegant, readable fonts. For the 'Resume' section, include a downloadable PDF and an interactive version on the page. 
    Make the site responsive so it looks great on both desktop and mobile.Make up some fictional details to showcase skills that don't currently exist on my resume or in projects, such as fun names for the projects
    and unique challenges that were 'overcome' during development to make the content more engaging.
